# Recertification Policy

## Purpose

AWC listings should age visibly. A registry entry that was credible at publication time may become stale when the protocol changes, the project changes, or the underlying evidence expires.

## Policy by listing level

### Self-tested

Self-tested entries are informational and should be treated as short-lived. They should be refreshed whenever the declaration changes materially or when the referenced compliance report is replaced.

### Compatible

Compatible entries should be re-reviewed whenever:

- the project changes its declaration in a way that affects scope, authority, escalation, audit, memory, budget, or performance claims;
- a self-hosted worker changes its published invocation or healthcheck surface in a way that affects the declaration artifact or attached evidence;
- the referenced AWC protocol version changes materially; or
- the evidence is older than 180 days.

### Certified

Certified entries should be recertified whenever:

- the project has a material declaration or behavior change;
- the AWC protocol receives a compatibility-impacting release;
- the test-suite certification logic changes in a way that affects outcome interpretation; or
- the certification is older than 90 days.

## Registry actions on expiry

Once a certification passes its validity window without recertification, the registry should mark the entry as expired or downgrade it to a weaker trust level until fresh evidence is published.

## Why the windows are short

The AWC ecosystem is about operational responsibility, not one-time badges. Short recertification windows preserve credibility by making listings version-aware, evidence-aware, and sensitive to real project drift.
