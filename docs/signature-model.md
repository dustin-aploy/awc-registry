# Signature Model

## Why signatures exist

Registry entries point to public compliance evidence. Detached signatures help a consumer verify that the published compliance report has not been altered after issuance or mirroring.

## Scope of signing

The recommended artifact to sign is the exact JSON byte stream of the published `AWCComplianceReport` file after canonical serialization for distribution. The registry entry itself may also be signed in future deployments, but the report is the minimum trust artifact for AWC compatibility evidence.

For self-hosted workers, the registry may additionally reference declaration-hosted invocation metadata, but the signed compliance report remains the primary portable trust artifact in this phase.

## Detached signature approach

This repository models a detached-signature workflow:

- `reports/compliance-report.example.json` contains the report payload; and
- `reports/compliance-report.example.sig` contains detached signature metadata and signature bytes.

A practical deployment may use Ed25519, Sigstore, Minisign, or another verifiable public-key signature system, but the registry should always publish:

- the signing algorithm;
- the signer identity or issuer;
- the key identifier or certificate chain reference;
- the digest of the signed artifact; and
- the detached signature value.

## Verification expectations

A registry reviewer should verify that:

1. the digest in the signature metadata matches the report file;
2. the signature verifies against the declared key material;
3. the signer identity is appropriate for the listing level; and
4. the report being signed is the same report referenced from the registry entry.

## Limits

A valid signature proves integrity and provenance of the signed artifact. It does **not** prove that the underlying project remains secure, unchanged, or still compliant after the signed report was issued.
